### Contributor's Manual
Hey there ! This is the very start of this project thus there is no code written yet. I believe in the community and look forward to your contributions. It is very basic project created for people learning Kotlin and Android Development. All you need is the learning spirit. In one line all we are doing is consuming and a REST API.
